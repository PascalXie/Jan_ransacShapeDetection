step5-cgalCMake:
We successfully compiled the CGAL with CMake.
Shape detection has been checked. 
Shapes include plane and cylinder are studied.

----
------------
step6-shapeDetect:
Cylinders were detected in step6-shapeDetect.
Point clouds of the cylinder are generated by ourselves with QT.

----
------------
step7-shapeDetectWithRealPointCloud:
Point clouds are observed by the 3D camera.
Efficient RANSAC shape detection method is used.

----
------------
step8-planeDetectWithHough:
We propose a plane detection method which uses Hough transformation.
